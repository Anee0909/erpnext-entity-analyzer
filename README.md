# ERPNext SalesInvoice Code Analyzer

## Overview
This project is a lightweight **code analysis tool** built as part of an AI Engineering pre-internship assignment.  
It analyzes a real-world **ERPNext legacy codebase** to extract structured knowledge about a core business entity: **SalesInvoice**.

The goal is to demonstrate how enterprise systems encode business logic in code and how that knowledge can be programmatically extracted.

---

## Problem Statement
Legacy enterprise systems are large, complex, and poorly documented.  
Understanding entities, relationships, and business rules is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project addresses that problem by:
- Parsing entity schema definitions
- Extracting business logic methods
- Producing structured, machine-readable output

## Project Scope
- **Target System:** ERPNext (Open-source ERP)
- **Analyzed Entity:** SalesInvoice
- **Language:** Python
- **Approach:** Static code and metadata analysis
