## What I Did
- Selected ERPNext as the target system for analysis
- Focused on the SalesInvoice entity
- Parsed entity schema from DocType JSON files
- Extracted business logic methods using Python AST

## Challenges Faced
- Navigating a large ERP codebase
- Handling relative vs absolute file paths
- Understanding how schema and logic are separated

## Learnings
- Business rules are deeply embedded in application code
- DocType JSON files clearly define data structure
- Absolute paths are safer than hardcoded relative paths

## Improvements If Time Permitted
- Deeper AST-based rule extraction
- Dependency graph creation
- Semantic querying of extracted entities
